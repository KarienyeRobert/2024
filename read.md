 # JavaScript Canvas Drawing: Creating and Animating Circles

This project demonstrates how to use the HTML5 canvas element to draw and animate circles using JavaScript. It includes step-by-step explanations and code snippets to help junior developers understand the concepts involved.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You should also have a code editor and a web browser installed on your computer.

## Project Setup

1. Create a new HTML file and save it as `index.html`.
2. Add the following code to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
```

This code creates a `<canvas>` element with the ID "canvas". This is where we will draw our circles.

3. Add the following code to the `<script>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

This code links the JavaScript file that contains the code for drawing and animating the circles.

## JavaScript Code

The JavaScript code for this project is contained in the `script.js` file. Let's go through the code step by step:

### 1. Getting the Canvas Context

```javascript
let canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
let context = canvas.getContext("2d");
```

These lines of code get a reference to the canvas element and its 2D drawing context. The context object provides methods and properties for drawing shapes, lines, and text on the canvas.

### 2. Setting Canvas Dimensions

```javascript
var window_height = window.innerHeight;
var window_width = window.innerWidth;

canvas.height = innerHeight;
canvas.width = innerWidth;
```

These lines of code get the height and width of the browser window and set the height and width of the canvas to match the window dimensions. This ensures that the canvas fills the entire browser window.

### 3. Setting Canvas Background Color

```javascript
canvas.style.background = "#ffa";
```

This line of code sets the background color of the canvas to light orange.

### 4. Drawing Rectangles

```javascript
context.fillStyle = "blue";

context.fillRect(300,0,100,200);
context.fillRect(100,500,100,200
